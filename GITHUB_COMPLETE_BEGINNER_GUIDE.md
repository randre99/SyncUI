# PART 3: Upload Your App to GitHub (15 minutes)

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and **sign in**
2. Click the green **"New"** button (or the "+" icon → "New repository")
3. Fill out the repository form:
   - **Repository name**: `SyncUI` (exactly like this)
   - **Description**: `Collaborative Angular App with Real-time Synchronization`
   - **Public**: ✅ Keep this selected (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Add a README file**: ❌ Leave this UNCHECKED
   - **Add .gitignore**: ❌ Leave this UNCHECKED  
   - **Choose a license**: ❌ Leave this UNCHECKED
4. Click **"Create repository"**

✅ **Your repository is created!** GitHub will show you a page with commands - keep this page open.

## Step 2: Connect Your Local App to GitHub

Open **PowerShell** in your project folder:
1. Press `Windows key + R`
2. Type `powershell` and press Enter
3. Navigate to your project: `cd "c:\Users\Regis\_RegisGitProjects\SyncUI"`

Now run these commands **one by one** (copy and paste each line, press Enter, wait for it to finish):

```powershell
# Step 1: Initialize Git in your project
git init

# Step 2: Add all your files
git add .

# Step 3: Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Collaborative Angular App"

# Step 4: Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Step 5: Connect to your GitHub repository
# 🛑 STOP! DO NOT copy the line below as-is!
# You MUST replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual GitHub username first!
# 
# Find your GitHub username:
# 1. Go to github.com and sign in
# 2. Look at the top-right corner - you'll see your username
# 3. Replace YOURUSERNAME in the command below with that username
#
# Examples:
# If your username is 'johnsmith2024':
# git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith2024/SyncUI.git
# If your username is 'mary-developer':
# git remote add origin https://github.com/mary-developer/SyncUI.git

# If you get "remote origin already exists" error, first run:
# git remote remove origin

# NOW replace YOURUSERNAME below and run the command:
# For user 'randre99', the correct command is:
git remote add origin https://github.com/randre99/SyncUI.git

# Step 6: Upload to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Important**: In step 5, replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

### If Git Asks for Login:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Your GitHub password (or Personal Access Token if you have 2FA enabled)

✅ **Your code is now on GitHub!** Refresh your GitHub repository page to see your files.

# PART 4: Deploy the Backend (Socket.IO Server) (10 minutes)

Your app has two parts: frontend (Angular) and backend (Socket.IO server). Let's deploy the backend first.

## ⚠️ Multiple GitHub Accounts Issue
If Railway tries to connect to your work GitHub instead of personal, use **Option B: Render** below, or follow the account switching steps in the troubleshooting section.

## Option A: Railway

### Step 1: Sign Up for Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"Login"** → **"Login with GitHub"**
3. Click **"Authorize Railway"** when GitHub asks
4. Complete any required verification

### Step 2: Deploy Your Server
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose **"SyncUI"** from the list
4. Railway will automatically detect your Node.js server in the `/server` folder
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Get Your Server URL
1. Click on your deployed service
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Copy the URL (looks like: `https://syncui-server-production-abc123.up.railway.app`)

✅ **Your backend is live!** Keep this URL - you'll need it next.

## Option B: Render (Alternative)

### Step 1: Sign Up for Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click **"Get Started for Free"** → **"GitHub"**
3. Click **"Authorize Render"** when GitHub asks

### Step 2: Deploy Your Server
1. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
2. Connect your **"SyncUI"** repository
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Name**: `syncui-server`
   - **Root Directory**: `server`
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: Keep "Free"
4. Click **"Create Web Service"**
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

### Step 3: Get Your Server URL
1. Copy the URL from the top of your service page
2. Looks like: `https://syncui-server.onrender.com`

✅ **Your backend is live!**

---

# PART 5: Configure Frontend for Production (5 minutes)

Now tell your Angular app where to find the deployed backend.

## Step 1: Update Environment File
1. Open your project in VS Code (or any text editor)
2. Navigate to: `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
3. Replace the file content with:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  websocketUrl: 'https://YOUR-BACKEND-URL-HERE'  // Replace with your Railway/Render URL
};
```

**Replace `YOUR-BACKEND-URL-HERE`** with the URL you copied in Part 4!

Example:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  websocketUrl: 'https://syncui-server-production-abc123.up.railway.app'
};
```

## Step 2: Save and Upload Changes
In PowerShell (in your project folder):

```powershell
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Configure production backend URL"

# Upload to GitHub
git push
```

✅ **Frontend is configured!**

---

# PART 6: Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages (5 minutes)

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/randre99/SyncUI`
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (at the top of your repository)
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. That's it! GitHub will automatically deploy when you push code.

## Step 2: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to **"Actions"** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow running called **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"**
3. Click on it to watch the progress
4. Wait for the green checkmark (takes 3-5 minutes)

✅ **Your app is now live!**

---

# PART 7: Access Your Live App! 🎉

Your collaborative Angular app is now live at:

**`https://randre99.github.io/SyncUI/`**

This is your permanent URL that you can share with collaborators worldwide!

## Test Your Deployment

1. **Open your app URL** in your browser
2. **Create a collaboration session**
3. **Share the URL** with someone in another country
4. **Test real-time features**:
   - Counter synchronization
   - Form input synchronization  
   - Navigation synchronization
   - Cursor tracking

# 🔧 Troubleshooting

## Railway Connects to Wrong GitHub Account
**Problem**: Railway tries to connect to your work GitHub instead of personal account (randre99).

**Solution**:
1. **Sign out of Railway completely**: Go to railway.app → Profile picture → "Sign out"
2. **Clear browser data**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` → Clear "Cookies and other site data" for railway.app
3. **Use incognito window**: Open new private/incognito browser window
4. **Sign into personal GitHub first**: Go to github.com → Make sure you're signed in as `randre99`
5. **Then go to Railway**: railway.app → "Login with GitHub" → Should now use personal account

**Alternative**: Use **Render instead** (Option B in Part 4) - it's less likely to have this account conflict.

## "Repository not found" Error
- Double-check your GitHub username in the git remote URL
- Make sure repository is set to "Public"

## "Permission denied" Error  
- Your GitHub credentials might be wrong
- Try logging out and back into GitHub

## App Loads But No Real-time Sync
- Check if backend URL is correct in `environment.prod.ts`
- Visit your backend URL directly - you should see a basic page
- Check browser console (F12) for WebSocket errors

## Backend Not Working
- Check Railway/Render dashboard for deployment errors
- Visit `https://your-backend-url/health` - should show server status

# 🎯 What You've Accomplished

✅ Created your first GitHub account
✅ Installed Git on your computer  
✅ Uploaded your code to GitHub
✅ Deployed backend server to Railway/Render
✅ Deployed frontend to GitHub Pages
✅ Configured production environment
✅ Got a permanent, shareable URL

Your app is now accessible worldwide with a professional URL!

## Next Steps

- **Share your URL** with collaborators anywhere in the world
- **Make updates**: Just edit code, then run `git add .`, `git commit -m "description"`, `git push`
- **Monitor usage**: Check Railway/Render dashboard for server statistics
- **Add features**: Your deployment automatically updates when you push to GitHub

**Congratulations! You're now a GitHub user with a live, collaborative web app!** 🚀
