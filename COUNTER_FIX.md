# Counter Synchronization Fix

## Problem
The synchronized counter in the collaborative editor was not syncing between browsers because:

1. **Missing Collaborative Events**: Counter methods were only updating local state via `StateSyncService.updateFormValue()` but not sending collaborative events to other users.

2. **No Server State Persistence**: The server was not storing session state, so new users joining a session would start with counter = 0 instead of the current value.

3. **Missing DOM Element Handling**: The `StateSyncService.applyFormChange()` method was trying to find DOM elements for non-DOM properties like 'counter'.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Counter Methods
Updated `incrementCounter()`, `decrementCounter()`, and `resetCounter()` methods in `collaborative-editor.component.ts` to:
- Send collaborative events via `collaborationService.sendEvent()`
- Include proper form-change event data with elementId: 'counter'
- Update local state via `stateSyncService.updateFormValue()`

### 2. Added Server State Management
Enhanced `CollaborationSession` class in `server.js` to:
- Store session state in `sessionState` Map
- Persist form-change events (including counter updates)
- Send initial state to new joiners via 'initial-state' event

### 3. Enhanced Client State Synchronization
Updated `StateSyncService.applyFormChange()` to:
- Handle special cases like 'counter' that don't correspond to DOM elements
- Still update local state for non-DOM properties

### 4. Added Initial State Handling
Enhanced collaborative editor to:
- Listen for 'initial-state' events when joining sessions
- Apply initial counter and other state values
- Update both component properties and StateSyncService

## Result
- Counter changes now broadcast to all connected users immediately
- New users joining a session receive the current counter value
- Counter synchronization works consistently across all browsers
- Server maintains session state for reliable synchronization

## Test Steps
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Create a session in one, join from the other
3. Increment/decrement counter in either browser
4. Verify counter updates in real-time across both browsers
5. Have one user leave and rejoin - should see current counter value
